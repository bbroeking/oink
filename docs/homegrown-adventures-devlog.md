# Homegrown Adventures — roadmap, version history, and devlog

This is the human-readable checkpoint record for the browser experiment. The
product contract remains in `docs/homegrown-adventures-build-goals.md`.

## Current roadmap

1. **v0.2 — Rosie Responds (shipped):** make the authored Rive rig the only
   Rosie on screen and make the first tickle visibly satisfying.
2. **v0.3 — Rosie Notices (shipped):** add restrained breathing
   plus a clear Notice pose that points to the Kitchen Patch without obscuring
   the DOM story card.
3. **v0.4 — Rosie's Bag (shipped):** register the satchel to Rosie's rig and
   make packing and returning visibly change the same persistent character.
4. **v0.5 — Living Barn (shipped):** bind the first crop bed to reducer state,
   beginning with one readable sprout, ready, and harvest consequence.
5. **v0.6 — Home Remembers:** replace the developed-state plate swap with one
   authored, lasting Glowroot-and-hedge consequence in the same Barn scene.

Depth and polish win over new crops, destinations, currencies, or parallel
systems. Each checkpoint starts with play and ships only after rendered proof.

## Version history

### v0.5.0 — Living Barn — 2026-08-05

- Added a native `bed_one_crop_rig` to the paid Tickle the Pig Rive workspace
  and retained its editable source export, vector source, deterministic runtime
  patch, and checked contract.
- Authored persisted empty, growing, and ready poses plus Plant, Ready Flourish,
  and Harvest one-shots. Every one-shot settles back to the reducer-owned pose.
- Kept the starting Barn plate fixed through the first farming loop so crop
  progress changes one Kitchen Patch bed instead of swapping the whole scene.
- Kept beds two and three out of the first loop's progression model and left
  farming timers, purpose, inventory, controls, and accessible copy in React.
- Preserved Rosie's breathing, rapid tickle interruption, Notice, Bag, Pack,
  and Return motion while the crop rig runs independently.
- Corrected the post-harvest story during rendered QA: once the bed is empty,
  the UI now says Clover Lunch is in Rosie's Bag and points toward packing.
- Content-hashed the generated browser bundle URL after rendered QA exposed a
  stale GitHub Pages script cache, so each shipped checkpoint loads its exact
  JavaScript as well as its exact Rive binary.
- Updated the companion site to link directly to the **Living Barn lab**.

### Validation evidence

- `npm run verify:rive-homegrown` — pass; 390×844 header and 42 authored names.
- `npm run prototype:homegrown:test` — 13/13 pass.
- `npm run prototype:homegrown:build` — pass with the authored Rive scene.
- `npm run quality:check` — pass, including TypeScript, 157-file layout gate,
  324 sprite integrity checks, security contracts, and 280 Jest assertions.
- Rendered public Chrome play at 390×844 — reset showed the empty first bed;
  Plant moved through `plant` to `growing`; ten rapid tickles left the crop
  stable; elapsed time moved through `flourish` to `ready`; reload retained the
  ready pose; Harvest moved through `harvest` to `empty`; Pack still equipped
  Rosie's Bag; and reduced motion snapped both Rosie and crop to readable
  reducer-selected poses.
- Visual comparison with `02-first-payoff.png` confirmed the same fixed camera,
  single full Clover Lunch bed, warm paper-cut language, and DOM-owned controls.
- GitHub Pages shipped commits `ff33c19` and `3fe8258`; the companion site
  exposes **Play the Living Barn lab**.
- Mobile Safari/device sharpness, haptic feel, and audible acceptance remain
  manual gates; this browser checkpoint does not claim those device checks.

### v0.4.0 — Rosie's Bag — 2026-08-05

- Authored the tan clover satchel as one native `rosie_satchel` vector group,
  matching the approved developed-Barn concept without obscuring Rosie's face.
- Registered the Bag to Rosie's body with offset-preserving translation,
  rotation, and scale constraints so it follows breathing and tickle poses.
- Added exact `Rosie Pack`, `Rosie Return`, and `Rosie Bag Hidden` timelines to
  the checked Rive contract and retained the editable paid-workspace export.
- Made the reducer's persisted `satchelEquipped` fact authoritative: the Bag is
  absent before packing, appears during Pack, survives reload, remains attached
  through rapid tickles, and receives one warm Return emphasis.
- Kept all packing choices, inventory facts, controls, and accessible copy in
  DOM/React. This checkpoint adds no inventory screen, destination, currency,
  or parallel equipment system.
- Updated the companion site to link directly to the **Rosie's Bag lab**.

### Local validation evidence

- `npm run verify:rive-homegrown` — pass; 390×844 header and 36 authored names.
- `npm run prototype:homegrown:test` — 13/13 pass.
- `npm run prototype:homegrown:build` — pass with the authored Rive scene.
- `npm run quality:check` — pass, including TypeScript, 157-file layout gate,
  324 sprite integrity checks, security contracts, and 280 Jest assertions.
- GitHub Pages deployed checkpoint `cd82e0c`; the public runtime reported the
  authored Rive asset `ready` and the companion site exposed the new lab link.
- Rendered desktop Chrome play at the 390×844 reference layout — reset hid the
  Bag; Pack equipped it; ten rapid tickles all restarted cleanly and settled to
  breathing with the Bag registered; Return emphasized it once; reload retained
  the equipped state; and reduced motion stopped character loops without hiding
  the Bag or changing accessible DOM state.
- Mobile Safari/device sharpness, haptic feel, and audible acceptance remain
  manual gates; this browser checkpoint does not claim those device checks.

### v0.3.0 — Rosie Notices — 2026-08-05

- Authored `Rosie Breathing Idle` on the foreground rig as a restrained
  one-second rise followed by a 2.25-second restful hold. Rosie now feels alive
  while waiting without becoming a visual metronome.
- Authored `Rosie Notice` as a clear lean toward the Kitchen Patch and layered
  it after the first meaningful tickle, so the character—not a floating panel—
  directs attention to what changed.
- Made breathing, tickle, and notice deterministic and interruptible. Rapid
  tickles restart from a valid pose; every one-shot returns to breathing.
- Honored reduced motion by stopping all authored loops and reactions while
  retaining the same readable game state.
- Lowered the notice story card so it supports rather than obscures Rosie's
  gesture, and retained all accessible product copy and controls in the DOM.
- Added the three exact animation names to the checked Rive contract and added
  a content hash to the published `.riv` URL so GitHub Pages and browsers cannot
  silently reuse an older character export.
- Added a direct **Play the Rosie lab** link to the companion website.

### Local validation evidence

- Rendered Chromium play — authored asset reports `ready`; the 3.25-second
  breathing cadence, single tickle, a ten-tap rapid-input stress pass, clean
  settle, first-return notice lean, and reduced-motion stability were verified
  at the 390×844 reference frame.
- Visual comparison — the starting Barn still preserves the fixed camera,
  Rosie scale, Kitchen Patch, paper-cut scene language, and uncluttered face
  established by `01-starting-barn.png`.
- Mobile Safari/device sharpness, haptic feel, and audible acceptance remain
  manual gates; this browser checkpoint does not claim those device checks.

### v0.2.0 — Rosie Responds — 2026-08-05

- Renamed the paid Rive workspace to **Tickle the Pig**.
- Recovered and adapted the existing Rosie mesh/bone rig instead of replacing
  it with CSS motion.
- Added the exact Homegrown artboard, state-machine, View Model, enum, boolean,
  and trigger contract; retained a deterministic metadata patch step because
  the editor currently duplicates generated data-property names.
- Fixed two export failures found by playing the real build: the artboard's
  opaque fill and `pig_skin` being set to `Prevent Export / Referenced`.
- Embedded Rosie's 370×383 texture, made the 390×844 artboard transparent, and
  authored the `Rosie Tickle` squash/lift/settle motion on the foreground rig.
- Generated three non-destructive scene-plate derivatives that remove only
  static Rosie while preserving the approved concepts as references.
- Restarted rapid tickles instead of stacking transforms; reduced motion keeps
  the pose legible while progression, sound policy, and counters remain DOM
  owned.

### Validation evidence

- `npm run verify:rive-homegrown` — pass; 390×844 header and 30 contract names.
- `npm run prototype:homegrown:test` — 13/13 pass.
- `npm run quality:check` — pass, including TypeScript, 157-file layout gate,
  324 sprite integrity checks, security contracts, and 280 Jest assertions.
- Rendered Chromium play — authored asset reports `ready`; transparent
  composition verified in starting and developed states; single tickle,
  three rapid 90 ms tickles, 700 ms settle, and reduced-motion tickle verified.
- Remaining manual gate — current iOS Safari/device sharpness, haptic feel, and
  audio acceptance.

### Next highest-leverage weakness

Rosie, her Bag, and the first crop bed now respond inside one stable Barn, but
the developed state still arrives as a whole scene-plate replacement. Author
one lasting Glowroot-and-hedge consequence in the existing Rive scene before
adding residents, destinations, additional crops, or collection UI.
