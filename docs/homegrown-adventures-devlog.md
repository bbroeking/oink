# Homegrown Adventures — roadmap, version history, and devlog

This is the human-readable checkpoint record for the browser experiment. The
product contract remains in `docs/homegrown-adventures-build-goals.md`.

## Current roadmap

1. **v0.2 — Rosie Responds (shipped):** make the authored Rive rig the only
   Rosie on screen and make the first tickle visibly satisfying.
2. **v0.3 — Rosie Notices (shipped):** add restrained breathing
   plus a clear Notice pose that points to the Kitchen Patch without obscuring
   the DOM story card.
3. **v0.4 — Rosie's Bag:** author the registered satchel and held-item anchors,
   then validate pack, return, and rapid-trigger settling.
4. **v0.5 — Living Barn:** bind crop beds, residents, the Hedge Bell, and the
   developed crossing one consequence at a time.

Depth and polish win over new crops, destinations, currencies, or parallel
systems. Each checkpoint starts with play and ships only after rendered proof.

## Version history

### v0.3.0 — Rosie Notices — 2026-08-05

- Authored `Rosie Breathing Idle` on the foreground rig as a restrained
  one-second rise followed by a 2.25-second restful hold. Rosie now feels alive
  while waiting without becoming a visual metronome.
- Authored `Rosie Notice` as a clear lean toward the Kitchen Patch and layered
  it after the first meaningful tickle, so the character—not a floating panel—
  directs attention to what changed.
- Made breathing, tickle, and notice deterministic and interruptible. Rapid
  tickles restart from a valid pose; every one-shot returns to breathing.
- Honored reduced motion by stopping all authored loops and reactions while
  retaining the same readable game state.
- Lowered the notice story card so it supports rather than obscures Rosie's
  gesture, and retained all accessible product copy and controls in the DOM.
- Added the three exact animation names to the checked Rive contract and added
  a content hash to the published `.riv` URL so GitHub Pages and browsers cannot
  silently reuse an older character export.
- Added a direct **Play the Rosie lab** link to the companion website.

### Local validation evidence

- Rendered Chromium play — authored asset reports `ready`; the 3.25-second
  breathing cadence, single tickle, a ten-tap rapid-input stress pass, clean
  settle, first-return notice lean, and reduced-motion stability were verified
  at the 390×844 reference frame.
- Visual comparison — the starting Barn still preserves the fixed camera,
  Rosie scale, Kitchen Patch, paper-cut scene language, and uncluttered face
  established by `01-starting-barn.png`.
- Mobile Safari/device sharpness, haptic feel, and audible acceptance remain
  manual gates; this browser checkpoint does not claim those device checks.

### v0.2.0 — Rosie Responds — 2026-08-05

- Renamed the paid Rive workspace to **Tickle the Pig**.
- Recovered and adapted the existing Rosie mesh/bone rig instead of replacing
  it with CSS motion.
- Added the exact Homegrown artboard, state-machine, View Model, enum, boolean,
  and trigger contract; retained a deterministic metadata patch step because
  the editor currently duplicates generated data-property names.
- Fixed two export failures found by playing the real build: the artboard's
  opaque fill and `pig_skin` being set to `Prevent Export / Referenced`.
- Embedded Rosie's 370×383 texture, made the 390×844 artboard transparent, and
  authored the `Rosie Tickle` squash/lift/settle motion on the foreground rig.
- Generated three non-destructive scene-plate derivatives that remove only
  static Rosie while preserving the approved concepts as references.
- Restarted rapid tickles instead of stacking transforms; reduced motion keeps
  the pose legible while progression, sound policy, and counters remain DOM
  owned.

### Validation evidence

- `npm run verify:rive-homegrown` — pass; 390×844 header and 30 contract names.
- `npm run prototype:homegrown:test` — 13/13 pass.
- `npm run quality:check` — pass, including TypeScript, 157-file layout gate,
  324 sprite integrity checks, security contracts, and 280 Jest assertions.
- Rendered Chromium play — authored asset reports `ready`; transparent
  composition verified in starting and developed states; single tickle,
  three rapid 90 ms tickles, 700 ms settle, and reduced-motion tickle verified.
- Remaining manual gate — current iOS Safari/device sharpness, haptic feel, and
  audio acceptance.

### Next highest-leverage weakness

Rosie can react and direct attention, but she cannot yet look prepared for an
Adventure. Author Rosie's registered Bag, strap, and held-item anchors, then
validate pack, return, and rapid-trigger settling before animating crops or
adding destinations.
